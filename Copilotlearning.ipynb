    "# q: What is the definiton of computer vision?\n",
    "# a: Computer vision is the field of study that deals with how computers can be made to gain high-level understanding from digital images or videos.\n",
    "#  From the perspective of engineering, it seeks to automate tasks that the human visual system can do.\n",
    "#  Computer vision tasks include methods for acquiring, processing, analyzing and understanding digital images, and extraction of high-dimensional data from the real world in order to produce numerical or symbolic information, e.g. in the forms of decisions.\n",
    "#  Understanding in this context means the transformation of visual images (the input of the retina) into descriptions of the world that make sense to thought processes and can elicit appropriate action.\n",
    "#  This image understanding can be seen as the disentangling of symbolic information from image data using models constructed with the aid of geometry, physics, statistics, and learning theory.\n",

    "#q: how are machine learning and AI used in Computer vision ?\n",
    "# a: Machine learning is a subset of AI that uses statistical techniques to enable machines to improve with experience.\n",
    "#  Machine learning algorithms are used in computer vision for object detection, object classification, segmentation, and image restoration.\n",
    "#  Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses multi-layered artificial neural networks to deliver state-of-the-art accuracy in tasks such as object detection, speech recognition, language translation and others.\n",
